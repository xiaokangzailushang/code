    <div id="tresc1"><h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>How much does a website cost?</b></p>
      <p>The cost or a website depends on three factors:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the size of the 
          project (number of pages, number of photos) - a three-page 
          website will cost less than a site with several 
          thousand pages</li>
        <li>the calibre 
          of the design (static graphics will cost less than animations or videos and 
          sounds)</li>
        <li>the functionality requirements (forms, payments, content 
          management, galleries, blogs, chatrooms, newsletter systems, 
          statistics...)</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="text-align: center"> <a class="mov" rel="nofollow" href="calc/order.htm" target="_blank"> <img src="images/website_cost_calculator-1.gif" width="150" height="120" alt="calculate how much a website costs online - website design cost calculator"></a></p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><b>What information is required to get started with a 
        web design project?</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>the objectives of the website (credibility, 
          information/cost reduction, enquiries/sales 
          generation)</li>
        <li>the domain name to 
          register (or access details to an already-registered domain)</li>
        <li>list of keywords for which you want the website 
          to be visible in search engines</li>
        <li>branding info - any 
          logos or graphic headers, or instructions to create them</li>
        <li>marketing info - slogans, headlines, 3 good reasons why you are 
          the best, profile of clients you want to attract</li>
        <li>structure - number of pages-subpages </li>
        <li>functionality - for both the visitor (eg. forms, payments) and 
          yourself (eg. admin console to make changes, send newsletters, 
          view statistics)</li>
        <li>content - the wording and images for the pages, or instructions 
          to create them.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>What do you mean by website objectives?</b></p>
      <p>Generally speaking, for any activity to be undertaken in business 
        (profitably), it must result in either (1) 
        sales/revenue growth, or (2) cost reduction. For most 
        businesses, the objective of their first website to 
        reduce marketing costs: when a customer calls with 
        an enquiry, instead of sending out a catalogue or 
        arranging a meeting to present their product, they 
        can simply refer them to the information on their 
        website.</p>
      <p>In addition, of course, a professional website will add to 
        the credibility of your business.</p>
      <p>If cost reduction is the only objective, ie. the website 
        is not meant to bring in new business, there is no 
        need for features such as search engine optimisation 
        and internet advertising, some of which can be very 
        expensive. In this scenario the business can save a 
        lot of unnecessary expense simply by being clear 
        about the project's objectives.</p>
      <p>Obviously, if the objective is enquiries and/or 
        sales generation, the list of keyword phrases for 
        search engine visibility will become most important. 
        Special care should be taken when defining those 
        keyword phrases.</p>
      <p><b>How does a website make money?</b></p>
      <p>In three simple steps:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Attract visitors to the website (traffic 
          generation)</li>
        <li>Convert visitors to enquirers (conversion)</li>
        <li>Convert enquirers to customers (sell to 
          them).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>What are the options of attracting visitors to 
        my website?</b></p>
      <p>The most common is to optimise the website for search engine 
        visibility for defined keyword phrases, so it can be found in 
        google searches most relevant to the product or service you want 
        to sell. However, some clients may prefer to attract visitors by 
        using off-line advertising methods, especially if their keywords 
        are very competitive. In this case, you can advertise your 
        website in the other media (including social media), through mailouts, letterbox drops, personal marketing (such as networking) etc.</p>
      <p>Another option is using google adwords. Here you pay google direct to put your ad (with a link to your website) on the search results for desired phrases (as distinct from paying a professional like us to position your website within the organic ranking results). Google will charge you per click - every time anyone clicks on your ad you will be charged, the amount depending on the competitiveness of the search phrase (from as little as 10 cents to as much as $100+ per click). The advantages of adwords are speed (your ad can appear there today) and control (switch it on and off as you please), the disadvantage is cost.</p>
      <p><b>What determines google ranking?</b></p>
      <p>Your ranking (for any given keyword phrase) depends on 
        two factors: </p>
      <p>1.	Phrases proximity to the search</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How close are your keywords to those being searched (keyword selection)</li>
        <li>How often do they occur on the page (keyword density)</li>
        <li>Where do they occur (keyword weight) </li>
      </ul>
      <p>2.	Site popularity</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How many links point to your site from the web?</li>
        <li>Weight of those links – relevance and ranking of linking sites</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The most important part for you is to supply your 
        web designer with a well-thought list of keyword 
        phrases for which you want your website to rank, if 
        possible no more than ten, in priority order. The 
        best possible source of ideas for the right phrases 
        are your customers - simply ask them what would they 
        type into google when searching for your product or 
        service.</p>
      <p>Once your website is built, you can test those 
        phrases with google adwords, checking which ones 
        deliver you the most enquiries and the highest rate 
        of conversion of enquiries to sales.</p>
      <p><b>How many keywords can I have on my website?</b></p>
      <p>There is no limit, however the more keywords you 
        list the less weight each of them will get. In 
        simple terms, google assigns a weight of 100 to your 
        website, so if you have 100 keywords each of them 
        will have a weight of 1; if you have one keyword it 
        will weigh 100; and if you put the whole dictionary 
        there each keyword's weight will be close to zero.</p>
      <p><b>What is search engine positioning?</b></p>
      <p>Another approach to SEO is to position the site 
        for specific ranking on specific keyword set (search 
        engine positioning). An example could be to position 
        your website on the first page for &quot;accountant 
        melbourne&quot;.</p>
      <p>This option is quite expensive, often in 
        excess of $10,000 per year per phrase (the cost 
        will of course depend on the competitiveness of each 
        phrase), although on the other hand the results are 
        guaranteed (meaning you don't get invoiced for 
        periods when the ranking is not achieved or 
        maintained).</p>
      <p>If you are interested in search engine 
        positioning service, we recommend the following 
        process:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>keyword phrase definition - the first step 
          is for you to define the exact phrase(s) for 
          which you want to achieve first page ranking; 
          each phrase should be tested with adwords for 
          conversion</li>
        <li>make note of the current ranking for each of 
          the defined phrases</li>
        <li>re-write your current website (especially 
          home page) content to emphasise the new phrase(s)</li>
        <li>allow time for indexing and evaluate the 
          ranking again</li>
        <li>if ranking still unsatisfactory, order 
          specific positioning (the cost will depend on 
          the competitiveness of the phrase, roughly 
          between $10K - $50K per phrase, with result 
          guaranteed for a year).</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>What is responsive design?</strong></p>
      <p>Responsive design means that one and the same website shows itself differently depending on the device it is being viewed on. For example, the website content may be showing in three columns on a desktop screen, and in a single column on a smartphone (so phone users don’t have to scroll sidewise). This is different than building a separate website for mobile phone viewing; here the website is the same, just its layout changes.</p>
      <p>Have a look at this very page - use your mouse (or your fingers) to resize the window you are watching this page on, to see how its width adjusts to the width of the window, and how the animated header (that would not show on smartphones) disappears once a phone resolution is reached, to be replaced by large full-width navigation buttons (easy to click on with your fingers).</p>
      <p><strong>Why invest in responsive design?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The use of smartphones and tablets to browse the internet is growing exponentially (although admittedly it differs per market segment - you need a reasonable proportion of your customers/prospects to be using smartphones for browsing, for investing in responsive design to make commercial sense)</li>
        <li>Avoid content duplication that can reduce your search ranking (common problem with having a separate mobile site)</li>
        <li>CMS sites easier to administer (single location for content)</li>
        <li>Same url for all views (better for SEO and social networks sharing)</li>
        <li>Recommended by Google for better user experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Does it matter where a website is hosted?</b></p>
      <p>Yes, the rule is to host your website as close as 
        practicable to the market you are targeting. Google 
        recognises the physical location of your hosting 
        server, and it will lower your ranking for 
        geographically restricted searches if you are hosted 
        elsewhere; for instance, if you are an Australian 
        accountant but your website is hosted in the US 
        (which may save you $100 or so a year), if your 
        prospect searches for accountants and restricts the 
        search to &quot;pages from Australia&quot;, you may not come 
        up, or at least your ranking will be lower. Google determines whether or not you are from Australia by your domain name (au at the end helps) and the physical location of your hosting server; it is to your advantage to have both those factors covered.</p>
      <p>In addition, for Australian businesses, hosting overseas has 
        the disadvantage of slowing down the loading time, 
        because of our slow intercontinental connections. Since you may 
        lose up to 20% of your visitors for every additional second of 
        loading time (depending on your target market), slowing down the 
        site just by a couple of seconds may halve its chances of 
        commercial success.</p>
      <p>You should also take into account the level of service you require. For example, when your emails go down, would you like to grab the phone and talk to a real human being at the other end, or are you happy to accept online support with 48 hours response standard? Is domain name renewal included in the hosting, or charged separately? What if you need more space, ssl certificate, unique IP... - will you be able to upgrade? What if your website goes down (eg. because some software update on the server affects compatibility with your website's software), or it gets hacked- will you get the support you need?</p>
      <p>As a guide, for standard hosting (shared IP, 1gig space, no ssl) on Australian servers you should not pay more than $25 per month. Some US hosting sites advertise small hosting packages from as little as $1 per month - however the level of support is zero (obviously). Our standard hosting ranges from $150 to $200 (as we have the &quot;low cost&quot; reputation to maintain), and it includes domain renewals (if registered with us) and unlimited telephone support.</p>
      <p><strong>What is the difference between domain registration and hosting?</strong></p>
      <p>Those two are separate services. Domain registration is like registering a business name, while hosting is like paying rent on your business premises - indeed hosting is the rental you pay for the space your website (and any associated email accounts) occupies on the hosting server.</p>
      <p>For customer convenience, we offer free domain name renewal (one domain) with every hosting account (provided the domain is registered with us).</p>
      <p><strong>Domain registration scam warning</strong></p><img src="images/sw.gif" style="margin-left:20px" align="right" />
      <p>A few of our customers get caught in this scam every month (even though it is actually several years old), enough to issue this warning.</p>
      <p>The essence of the scam is selling domain registration at high prices. As a guide, domain registration or renewal should not cost more $100.</p>
      <p>Let's say you own a domain name yourbusinessname.com.au. Your contact details as the owner of this domain are on public record and can be harvested by scammers. One day you receive an officially looking invoice for domain name renewal for yourbusinessname.com for $250. The scammer hopes (correctly as it turns out) that a percentage of recipient won't notice the missing .au at the end and pay the bill.</p>
      <p>This scam is very clever as there is nothing illegal about it. The invoice is basically a sales letter, offering you domain registration. If you pay it, the scammer will indeed register this new domain for you, so the service you paid for will be delivered, making it a legitimate business transaction.</p>
      <p>A variation of this scam is a letter or email warning you about someone trying to infringe on your branding, eg. someone is trying to register yourbusinessname.ch, however for only a few hundred dollars we can secure this domain for you.</p>
      <p>How can you protect yourself? First of all, read your invoices carefully before paying them. In case of domain registration/renewal invoice, make sure you know exactly whether you are paying for a domain you already own (in our example yourbusinessname.com.au) or for a new domain you don't really need for anything (yourbusinessname.com). In addition, keep clear records about all the domains you own, so that at any time you can check whether or not any of them is due for renewal and who is the service provider. You may also consider consolidating all your domains and hosting account with a single supplier (preferably us...), so that you can simply discard invoices or sales letters coming from anyone else.      </p>
      <p><strong>How can I use YouTube to promote my business</strong>?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Demonstrating products/services - YouTube allows  you to show your business in action</li>
        <li>Promoting products/services - about half of  internet users searching for information will search YouTube before searching  Google</li>
        <li>Demonstrating expertise -  build reputation as an expert in your field</li>
        <li>Leveraging events or promotions - revisit  successful events by showing their video footage </li>
        <li>Provide solutions for your customers – eg.  videos demonstrating how to install or use your product.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In summary, if you are thinking of using videos on the web,  YouTube is the way to go. Not only you gain additional exposure for searches,  but also you save a lot of money – putting a YouTube video on your own website  will cost a fraction of what it would cost to create a custom video player, and  you don&rsquo;t have to use your own bandwidth too!</p>
      <p><strong>How does ranking work for YouTube searches?</strong></p>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s start by explaining what YouTube ranking is. For  example, you upload a video called &lsquo;best carpet cleaning service&rsquo; to promote  your carpet cleaning business. Obviously there will be plenty more videos on  carpet cleaning, so the question is: if a visitor searches YouTube for carpet  cleaning, what determines the ranking of those videos (of course you want to  end up on the first page)?</p>
      <p>In the past, the ranking was determined by the number of  views – the more views your video had, the higher its ranking. This setting  allowed for using tricks, such as buying views, so now the YouTube algorithm  has been changed to <strong>VIEWING TIME</strong>,  calculated as a percentage of your video&rsquo;s total time. So if your video is 2  minutes, and everyone viewing it watches it for the full 2 minutes (rather than  exits after a few seconds), this shows YouTube that it is of interest to users  doing this particular search, and consequently that ranking lifts. In other  words, if you want your video to rank high, you have to make it interesting  (fair enough). At the same time, don&rsquo;t take any offers to buy views, as it is  now a waste of money.</p>
